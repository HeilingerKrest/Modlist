# Preambule

"TES V : Skyrim - Secunda Edition" is a personal performance-friendly medium-sized Modlist that aims to offer an enhancement of the original graphics and gameplay of Skyrim. Here is the core motivation of this modlist : what we believed to be Skyrim back in 2011, our memories embellished by the nostalgia of this game, are embodied in this Modlist. 

Utilizing the power of Community Shaders, this Modlist offers enhanced visuals true to Skyrim: Grass Lighting, Grass Collision, Tree LOD Lighting, Screen-Space Shadow, and (Vanilla) HDR. Enhanced visuals and gameplay are to be expected in the same vein as the original Skyrim. Nothing more, nothing less, only Skyrim.

"TES V : Skyrim - Secunda Edition" version 1.0.0 enhances the potential present in Skyrim: landscapes, architectures, character appearances, weapons and armors. Future Updates will add more such as immersion mods and unofficial DLC-sized Mods depending on the feedbacks. 



# Requirements : 
_Requires AE Content, Skyrim 1.6640_

My specs are as follows: 
* i5-11400F, RTX 3060, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. 

The core visual mods are : 

* Community Shaders
* Skyrim Upscaler
* Vanilla HDR
* Vivid Weathers
 
These four mods ensure a high level of graphical quality and unparalleled performance. 

Made by Doodlum (ModAuthor), an enhanced AI on Nexus apparently, Community Shaders serves as a base for Screen-Space Shadows, Grass lighting, Grass Collision, Tree LOD Lighiting and Vanilla HDR.  

On the other hand, Skyrim Upscaler is here to help when needed, but also offers a better anti-aliasing with DLSS / DLAA enabled. You can find four presets : QUality, Balanced, Performance and Ultra-performance paired with multiple presets depending on which one you choose to go with.

Finally, Vivid Weather works magically with Vanilla HDR, delivering a next-gen upgrade to the image quality and graphics of Skyrim.

If you have my specs or better expect to run the game at 2k/4k 60fps without any inconveniences.

Once you have completed pre-installation, download the latest version of Wabbajack and place it in a folder such as C:\Games\Wabbajack. Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder. I recommend placing it on an SSD as it will work quicker on there.
